# FolderSync

**FolderSync** is a simple C# command-line utility that keeps a *replica* folder synchronized with a *source* folder.  
It performs **one-way synchronization**, making the replica an exact copy of the source at scheduled intervals. All file operations (copy, update, delete) are logged to both the console and a log file.

---

## Features

- One-way, recursive folder synchronization (source â†’ replica)
- Periodic sync at a user-defined interval (in seconds)
- Logs every file operation (create, update, delete) to both the console and a log file
- Simple command-line usage
- Fast and reliable (uses MD5 checks for file changes)
- Written in C# (.NET 6 or newer)

---

## Requirements

- **.NET 6 SDK or newer** ([Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Windows 10/11 recommended (but works on Linux/macOS if you use forward slashes in paths)
- No third-party synchronization libraries used
